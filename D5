Hello!

Welcome to our project........

It's all a mess right now, but our original plan was to write it out in coding
logic we understand, and convert it to the constrain logic from class.

The feedback we'd like is all written out in comments on run.py,
but for overall feedback we're looking for some help with understanding
what should be set as its own array and what should be converted to variables
in our run file.

For the most full version of the project, run GameDriver.py. 
It displays a user-friendly playable version of Reversi, even showing the
playable moves when given an unplayable coordinate.

The comments we've left are for ourselves mostly, but if something you see
looks like you would have some ideas, we would LOVE to hear them. So those would be our
"specific" feedback questions I suppose.

Thanks for reviewing our project!!!
